# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI
This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, designed to help administrators efficiently manage users, roles, and permissions. The application provides an intuitive and secure interface for user management, role assignment, and permission configuration.

## Project Description
The RBAC UI is an admin dashboard for managing user accounts, assigning roles, and configuring permissions. The interface is built with React Vite, offering a clean and responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various devices. The mock API simulates server-side CRUD operations, making it easy to test functionality.
